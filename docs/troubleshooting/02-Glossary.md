# **Glossary**

## **Active Nomination**
A validator (or validators) that a nominator has selected to nominate and is actively validating this era. The nominator is placing their stake behind this validator for this era and will potentially receive staking rewards in return for doing so.

---

## **Authority**
An authority is a generic term for the role in a blockchain that can participate in the consensus mechanisms. In GRANDPA, the authorities vote on chains they consider final. In BABE, the authorities are block producers. Authority sets can be chosen to be mechanisms such as Polkadot's NPoS algorithm.

---

## **BABE**
Blind Assignment of Block Extension (BABE) is Zukma Network block production mechanism.

---

## **Block**
A collection of data, such as transactions, that together indicate a state transition of the blockchain.

---

## **Block Explorer**
An application that allows a user to explore the different blocks on a blockchain.

---

## **Blocks Nominations**
This indicates that a validator does not currently allow any more nominations. This is controlled by the validator.

---

## **Bonding**
A process by which coins/tokens can be "frozen" in exchange for some other benefit. For example, staking is a form of bonding for which you receive rewards in exchange for securing the network.

---

## **Bounty**
A mechanism which works in some sense as the reverse of a Treasury Proposal, allowing the Zukma Network/Zukma Council to indicate that there is a need to do some task for the Zukma Network and allowing users to receive ZEP in return for working on that task.

---

## **Bridge**
A bridge is a piece of software that aims to increase interoperability between different blockchains. A bridge lets users convert their crypto assets into wrapped tokens of a destination chain.

---

## **Capacity**
The maximum number of nominators signalling intent to nominate a validator (and thus could potentially actively nominate that validator in the next session). This maximum number will equal the number of nominators necessary to oversubscribe a validator. Any validator which is "at capacity" or higher may potentially be oversubscribed in the next session; a validator that is not at capacity cannot be oversubscribed unless more nominators select it before the next election.

---

## **Commission**
Validators and nominators get paid from block production on the network, where validators can set a variable commission rate, which is initially subtracted from the total rewards that validator is entitled to (for that period), where the commission determines the rate of distribution for the remaining rewards set out for the nominators that are backing that validator.

---

## **Community Queue**
The queue for proposals originating from individual accounts (i.e. not the Council) which are waiting to become referenda. Compare the External queue.

---

## **Consensus**
The process of a group of entities to agree on a particular data value (such as the ordering and makeup of blocks on a blockchain). There are a variety of algorithms used for determining consensus. The consensus algorithm used by Zukma Network is BABE and GRANDPA.

---

## **Curator**
A person, group, or other entity charged with judging and verifying the successful completion of a Bounty.

---

## **Dapps**
A generic term for a decentralized application, that is, one that runs as part of a distributed network as opposed to being run on a specific system or set of systems.

---

## **Epoch**
An epoch is a time duration in the BABE protocol that is broken into smaller time slots. Each slot has at least one slot leader who has the right to propose a block.

---

## **Era**
A (whole) number of sessions, which is the period that the validator set (and each validator's active nominator set) is recalculated and where rewards are paid out.

---

## **Equivocation**
Providing conflicting information to the network. BABE equivocation entails creating multiple blocks in the same slot. GRANDPA equivocation would consist of signing multiple conflicting chains.

---

## **External Queue**
The queue for proposals originating with the Zukma Network/ Council which are waiting to become referenda. Compare the Community queue.

---

## **Extrinsic**
State changes that come from the outside world, i.e. they are not part of the system itself. Extrinsics can take two forms, "inherents" and "transactions".

---

## **Finality**
The property of a block that cannot be reverted. Generally, created blocks are not final until some point in the future - perhaps never, in the case of "probabilistic finality". The Zukma Network uses a deterministic finality gadget known as GRANDPA.

---

## **Finality Gadget**
A mechanism that determines finality.

---

## **Frame**
The collection of Substrate-provided pallets (Substrate Runtime Modules).

---

## **Genesis**
The origin of a blockchain, also known as block 0. It can also be used to reference the initial state of the blockchain at origination.

---

## **Governance**
The process of determining what changes to the network are permissible, such as modifications to code or movement of funds. The governance system in Zukma Network is on-chain and revolves around stakeholder voting.

---

## **Governance Council**
An on-chain entity that consists of several on-chain accounts (starting at 6, eventually moving to the final value of 24). The Council can act as a representative for "passive" (non-voting) stakeholders. Council members have two main tasks: proposing referenda for the overall stakeholder group to vote on and cancelling malicious referenda.

---

## **GRANDPA Finality Gadget**
GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement. It is the finality gadget for Zukma Network, which allows asynchronous, accountable, and safe finality to the blockchain. For an overview of GRANDPA, see [this Medium post.](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/polkadot-proof-of-concept-3-a-better-consensus-algorithm-e81c380a2372)

---

## **Hard Fork**
A permanent diversion of a blockchain occurs quickly due to a high priority change in a consensus rule. Clients who follow a hard fork always need to upgrade their clients to continue following the upgraded chain. Hard forks are considered permanent divergences of a chain for which non-upgraded clients are following consensus rules incompatible to the ones followed by upgraded clients.

---

## **Inactive Nomination**
A validator (or validators) that a nominator has selected to nominate, but is not actively validating this era. This type of nomination may become active in a future era.

---

## **Inherent**
Extrinsics that are "inherently true." Inherents are not gossiped on the network and are put into blocks by the block author. They are not provably true the way that the desire to send funds is, therefore they do not carry a signature. A blockchain's runtime must have rules for validating inherents. For example, timestamps are inherents. They are validated by being within some margin that each validator deems reasonable.

---

## **Injected Account**
An account that is not directly managed by the Substrate Explorer UI but can be accessed through it, such as accounts controlled by the Polkadot{.js} extension.

---

## **Interoperability**
The ability for some sort of system to exchange and make use of information often compared to "cross-chain" technologies.

---

## **Keep-Alive Check**
The keep-alive check is used to indicate whether or not a transfer can allow the sending account to be reduced to less than the existential deposit, causing it to be reaped.

---

## **Zukma Network**
The "canary network" for Zukma. It consists of an early-release, unaudited version of the Zukma software. It is not a testnet - after the transition to NPoS, the network is entirely in the hands of the community (i.e., Zukma Network coin holders).

---

## **LIBP2P**
An open-source library for encrypted peer-to-peer communications and other networking functions. More information at: https://libp2p.io/

---

## **Liveness**
The property of a distributed system is that it will eventually come to some sort of consensus. A system stuck in an infinite loop would not be considered live, even if computations are taking place; a system that eventually provides a result, even if incorrect or it takes a long time, is considered to have liveness.

---

## **Mainnet**
Short for "main network": the fully functional and acting chain that runs its own network.

---

## **Metadata**
Data that includes information about other data, such as information about a specific transaction.

---

## **Next Session**
This indicates that the validator will be a member of the active set in the next session.

---

## **Node Explorer**
A tool that gives you information about a node, such as the latest blocks sealed, finalized, and the current chain state as known by that node.

---

## **Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS)**
A Proof-of-Stake system where nominators back validators with their own stake as a show of faith in the good behavior of the validator. Nominated Proof-of-Stake differs from the more generic concept Delegated Proof-of-Stake in that nominators are subject to loss of stake if they nominate a bad validator; delegators are not subject to loss of stake based on the behavior of the validator. Note that some other blockchain technologies may use the term Delegated Proof-of-Stake, even if delegators can be slashed. Zukma Network uses the Phragm√©n method to allocate stake to nominees.

---

## **Nominator**
Accounts that select a set of validators to nominate by bonding their coins. Nominators receive some of the validators' rewards, but are also liable for slashing if their nominated validators misbehave.

---

## **Non-fungible Token (NFT)**
A non-fungible token is a token that does not hold the property of fungibility, which, in turn, means that it cannot be interchangeable and indistinguishable from other tokens. NFTs allow the tokenization of unique items and provide exclusive ownership for those tokens.

---

## **On-chain Governance**
A governance system of a blockchain that is controlled by mechanisms on the blockchain. On-chain governance allows decisions to be made transparently. Note that there are a variety of different algorithms for making these decisions, such as simple majority voting, adaptive quorum biasing, or identity-based quadratic voting.

---

## **Online Message**
This is a message that is broadcast by a validator to verify to the network that the validator is online, even if they haven't published a block this epoch. This is sometimes referred to as "ImOnline" or "Heartbeat Signal".

---

## **Origin**
The initiator of an extrinsic. A simple origin would be the account that is sending coins to another account. Substrate also supports more complex origin types, such as the root origin, from which privileged functions can be called.

---

## **Oversubscribed**
If more than the maximum number of nominators nominate the same validator, it is "oversubscribed", and only the top staked nominators (ranked by the amount of stake, up to the maximum number of nominators) are paid rewards. Other nominators will receive no rewards for that era. The current maximum number of nominators is 256 on Zukma Network, but it can be modified via governance.

---

## **Pallet**
A Substrate runtime module.

---

## **Parity Technologies**
A company, founded by Dr. Gavin Wood and Dr. Jutta Steiner, that is developing Substrate and Polkadot. It has also released several other projects including Parity Ethereum and Parity Secret Store.

---

## **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
A method of selecting participation in a consensus system, in which participants are chosen based on how many coins/tokens they have at stake (at risk of loss due to misbehavior). Normally, Proof-of-Stake systems limit the number of participants.

---

## **Proof of Work (PoW)**
A method of selecting participants in a consensus system, typically the longest chain rule, in which participants try to solve a puzzle like finding a partial pre-image of a hash. Normally, a Proof-of-Work system can have any number of participants.

---

## **Proposal**
A potential function call to be voted on in a referendum. Proposals modify the behavior of the Zukma Network, from minor parameter tuning up to replacing the runtime code.

---

## **Protocol**
A system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication and possible recovery methods.f

---

## **Random Seed**
A random seed is a pseudo-random number available on-chain. It is used in various places of the Zukma Network, most prominently in BABE the block production mechanism.

---

## **Referendum**
A vote on whether or not a proposal should be accepted by the network. Referenda may be initiated by the Governance Council, by a member of the public, or as the result of a previous proposal. Stakeholders vote on referenda, weighted by both the size of their stake (i.e. number of ZEP held) and the amount of time they are willing to lock their coins.

---

## **Re-Genesis**
Re-Genesis is the process of exporting the current chain state, and creating a new chain that builds on it. Re-Genesis will involve stop-the-world migration, which results in a period of time when no actual blocks are added to the blockchain. In a way, re-genesis can be viewed as a hard fork process. A formal design of Re-Genesis on Substrate is still under development - [Re-Genesis Rationale and Design](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7458).

---

## **Runtime**
The state transition function of a blockchain. It defines a valid algorithm for determining the state of the next block given the previous state.

---

## **Runtime Module**
A module that implements specific transition functions and features one might want to have in their runtime. Each module should have domain-specific logic. For example, a Balances module has logic to deal with accounts and balances. In Substrate, modules are called "pallets".

---

## **Safety**
The property of a distributed system indicating that a particular state transition will not be reverted. GRANDPA provides deterministic safety. That is, for a state changed marked as "safe" or "final", one would require a hard fork to revert that change.

---

## **Scalability**
While an ambiguous concept, [blockchain] scalability can be understood as the ability for the network to scale in capabilities (e.g. processing more transactions) when needed.

---

## **ZEP**
The native coin for Zukma. ZEP serves three purposes: network governance (allowing them to vote on-chain upgrades and other exceptional events), general operation (rewarding good actors and punishing bad actors), and bonding.

---

## **Sealing**
The process of adding a block to the Chain. Note that finalization is a separate process - blocks are finalized sometime after they are sealed.

---

## **Session**
A session is a Substrate implementation term for a period that has a constant set of validators. Validators can only join or exit the validator set at a session change.

---

## **Session Certificate**
A message containing a signature on the concatenation of all the Session keys. Signed by the Controller.

---

## **Session Key**
Hot keys that are used for performing network operations by validators, for example, signing GRANDPA commit messages.

---

## **Slashing**
The removal of a percentage of an account's ZEP as a punishment for a validator acting maliciously or incompetently (e.g., equivocating or remaining offline for an extended period).

---

## **Soft Fork**
A backward compatible change to client code causes upgraded clients to start mining a new chain. Requires a "vote-by-hashrate" of a majority of miners to enact successfully. Soft forks are considered temporary divergences in a chain since non-upgraded clients do not follow the new consensus rules but upgraded clients are still compatible with old consensus rules.

---

## **Staking**
The act of bonding coins (for Zukma Network, ZEP) by putting them up as "collateral" for a chance to produce a valid block (and thus obtain a block reward). Validators and nominators stake their ZEP in order to secure the network.

---

## **State transition function**
A function that describes how the state of a blockchain can be transformed. For example, it may describe how tokens can be transferred from one account to another.

---

## **Substrate**
A modular framework for building blockchains. Zukma Network are built using Substrate. Chains built with Substrate will be easy to connect as parachains.

---

## **Tabling**
In Zukma Network governance, bringing a proposal to a vote via referendum. Note that this is the British meaning of "tabling", which is different from the US version, which means "to postpone" a measure.

---

## **Teleport**
Send an asset from an account on one chain to an account on a different chain. This occurs by burning an amount on the sending chain and minting an equivalent amount on the destination chain.

---

## **Testnet**
Short for "test network": an experimental network where testing and development takes place. Networks are often executed on a testnet before they are deployed to a mainnet

---

## **Tokenization**
The process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive data.

---

## **Transfer**
Send an asset from one account to another. This generally refers to transfers that occur only on the same chain.

---

## **Transaction**
An extrinsic that is signed. Transactions are gossiped on the network and incur a transaction fee. Transactions are "provably true", unlike inherents. For example, one can prove that Alice wants to send funds to Bob by the fact that she signed a transfer-funds message with her private key.

---

## **Validator**
A node that secures the Chain by staking ZEP.

---

## **Voting**
The process of stakeholders determining whether or not a referendum should pass. Votes are weighted both by the number of ZEP that the stakeholder account controls and the amount of time they are willing to lock their ZEP.

---

## **Waiting Nomination**
The nominator has nominated this validator, but the validator was not elected into the active validator set this era and thus cannot produce blocks for the canonical chain. If the validator does get into the active set in a future era, this may turn into an active or inactive nomination.

---

## **Wallet**
A program that allows one to store private keys and sign transactions for Zukma Network or other blockchain networks.

---

## **Wasm**
The abbreviation for WebAssembly.

---

## **Web3 Foundation**
A Switzerland-based foundation that nurtures and stewards technologies and applications in the fields of decentralized web software protocols, particularly those that utilize modern cryptographic methods to safeguard decentralization, to the benefit and for the stability of the Web3 ecosystem.

---

## **WebAssembly**
An instruction format for a virtual, stack-based machine. Polkadot Runtime Modules are compiled to WebAssembly. Also known as Wasm.
