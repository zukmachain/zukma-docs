# <b>Deploy with Truffle</b>
---

In this section we will show you how to utilize the [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) to develop Smart Contracts for Zukma.
Tuffle, in short, is a solidity suite that helps you to test your code. 

Let's start with installing the technical requirements.

## **Installing Technical Requirements**
---

To use Truffle we need to install NodeJS v8.9.4 or later and we need a running eth-client.

!!! Note
    Since Zukma is fully Ethereum compatible you can use **Ganache** as the preferred eth-client

 Please go ahead and install NodeJS and Ganache.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

After you installed NodeJS and Ganache, you can execute the following command in your Terminal to install Truffle

```
npm install -g truffle
```

## ** Creating a Project**
---

In this guide we will utilize the MetaCoin Truffle Box, which is a Truffle project template. 
The MetaCoin Box allows us to create an ERC-20 token on Zukma that can be transferred between accounts. 

1. Create a new folder for your Truffle project and navigate into it:

```
mkdir MetaCoin
cd MetaCoin
```

2. Download und unbox the MetaCoin Box

```
truffle unbox metacoin
```

!!! Hint
    You can use the `truffe unbox <box-name>` command to download and unbox any [truffle box](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes)

!!! Hint
    If you want to start from scratch please use `truffle init`

Once you unboxed MetaCoin, you will be greeted with a project structure like this:

- `contracts/`: Directory for Solidity Contracts
- `migrations/`: Directory for scriptable deployment files
- `test/`: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
- `truffle.js`: Truffle configuration file 

![img](assets/metacoin-structure.png#center)

## **Exploring the Project**
---

1. Open the `contracts/MetaCoin.sol` file in a text editor. This is a smart contract (written in Solidity) that creates a MetaCoin token. Note that this also references another Solidity file `contracts/ConvertLib.sol` in the same directory.
2. Open the `contracts/Migrations.sol` file. This is a separate Solidity file that manages and updates the status of your deployed smart contract. This file comes with every Truffle project, and is usually not edited.
3. Open the `migrations/1_initial_migration.js` file. This file is the migration (deployment) script for the Migrations contract found in the `Migrations.sol` file.
4. Open the `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js` file. This file is the migration script for the MetaCoin contract. (Migration scripts are run in order, so the file beginning with 2 will be run after the file beginning with 1.)
5. Open the `test/TestMetaCoin.sol` file. This is a test file written in Solidity which ensures that your contract is working as expected.
6. Open the `test/metacoin.js` file. This is a test file written in JavaScript which performs a similar function to the Solidity test above.
7. Open the `truffle-config.js` file. This is the Truffle configuration file, for setting network information and other project-related settings. The file is blank, but this is okay, as we'll be using a Truffle command that has some defaults built-in.

!!! hint
    We will adjust the `truffle-config.js` later to deploy the Token to Ganache and later to Zukma

## **Testing**
---

Testing your smart contracts is an important step in the development pipeline. To run a test of the MetaCoin contract open up a terminal and run the solidity test:

### **Run the Solidity Test**
```
truffle test ./test/TestMetaCoin.sol
```

you will see the following output:

```
  TestMetaCoin
    √ testInitialBalanceUsingDeployedContract (607ms)
    √ testInitialBalanceWithNewMetaCoin (457ms)


  2 passing (16s)

```

### ***Run the Javascript Test**

```
truffle test ./test/metacoin.js
```

You will see the following output:

```
  Contract: MetaCoin
    √ should put 10000 MetaCoin in the first account (126ms)
    √ should call a function that depends on a linked library (258ms)
    √ should send coin correctly (976ms)


  3 passing (1s)
```

!!! Success
    The solidity and javascript test were successfull!


## **Compiling the Smart Contract**
---

After the successfull test we are ready to compile the smart contracts within the `contracts/` folder. 

```
truffle compile
```

You will see the following output:

```
Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling .\contracts\ConvertLib.sol
> Compiling .\contracts\MetaCoin.sol
> Compiling .\contracts\Migrations.sol
> Artifacts written to .\build\contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
```

## **Migrating with Ganache**
---

To migrate or upload your smart contract to the Ganache Blockchain you need to tell truffle where it to deploy the contract. 
We do this by adjusting the `truffle-config.js` file as follows:

- Open `truffle-config.js` in a text editor and replace the content with the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
};
```
Save and close the file 

### **Launch Ganache**

![img](assets/ganache.png#center)

### **Mirgrate to Ganache**

Now that we told truffle where to migrate the contracts we can migrate.

```
truffle migrate
```

You will see the following output:

```

This shows the transaction IDs and {==addresses of your deployed contracts==}. It also includes a cost summary and real-time status updates.

!!! hint
    **Hint:** Your transaction IDs and contract addresses may be different from the above.

In Ganache, click the "Transactions" button to see that the transactions have been processed.

![img](assets/ganache-tx.png#center)

!!! success
    You deployed a smart contract to the Ganache Blockchain!

## **Migrate to Zukma**
---

To deploy the smart contracts to Zukma, we need to make some adjustments.
First of all we need to install the truffle HDWallet package as follows:

`npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider`

HD Wallet is basically an instance of your wallet e.g., MetaMask that has access to the Zukma Network. 
Since a contract deployment involves transactions, you need to have your private key or your seed phrase ready.

Open the `truffle-config.js` file and replace its content with the following code:

```javascript
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
const privKey = '{==YOUR PRIVATE KEY GOES HERE==}';

module.exports = {  
    compilers: {    
        solc: {      
            version: "^0.6.0",
        }
    },  
    networks: {
        Zukma: {
            provider: () => new HDWalletProvider({
                privateKeys: [ privKey ],
                providerOrUrl: "https://rpc.zukma.org",
            }),
            network_id: 142,
        },  
    } 
}
```
Save the file.
You notice a few facts from here, our chainId is 142 and we are using solc version above ^0.6.0.

!!! Hint
    Make sure that the wallet which is attached to the private key you provided earlier is funded sufficiently to pay for the gas needed to deploy the smart contracts.

### **Migrate your Contracts to Zukma**

To deploy the smart contracts within your project you need to execute the following command:

```
truffle --network development migrate
```

You should see the following output:

!!! Success
    Congrats, you deployed your first smart contracts on the Zukma Network!

### **Check Deployment on Network Explorer**

To verfiy the successfull deployment head over to the <a href="https://evm.zukma.org/" target="_blank">EVM Testnet Explorer</a> and search for your {==Contract Address==}.

![img](assets/contract-deployed-explorer.png)

### **Interact with the Contract**

Since we didn't connect the logic of the smart contracts with a front end we need to interact with our contracts via the console.
You can do this in the following ways:

1. Invoke the truffle console:

```
truffle console 
```

You will see the following prompt:

```
truffle(development)>
```

2. Begin by establishing both the deployed MetaCoin contract instance and your Zukma wallet

!!! hint
    It is normal to get an `undefined` as response from the console after you executed one command

```
let instance = await MetaCoin.deployed()
let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
```

3. Check the metacoin balance of the account that deployed the contract:

```
let balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
balance.toNumber()
```

4. See how much ether that balance is worth (and note that the contract defines a metacoin to be worth 2 ether):

```
let ether = await instance.getBalanceInEth(accounts[0])
ether.toNumber()
```

5. Transfer some metacoin from one account to another:

```
instance.sendCoin({==TARGET ADDRESS==}, 500)
```
You should see the following result:

```

6. Check the balance of the account that received the metacoin:

```
let received = await instance.getBalance({==TARGET ADDRESS==})
received.toNumber()
```

7. Check the balance of the account that sent the metacoin:

```
let newBalance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
newBalance.toNumber()
```
!!! Success
    Congrats, you succesfully depolyed 3 smart contracts to Zukma via Truffle and Meta Mask!
